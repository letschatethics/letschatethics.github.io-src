           <i>Let's Chat Ethics</i> is a passion project born out of friendship and a common interest: ethical AI. We met while working for an AI ethics start-up 
           and after many, many AI rants and wanting to keep working together, we decided to start this podcast.     

        </p>
        <p>
            To say that AI has taken over the world would be an understatement, and more recently the moral issues surrounding AI have been a constant source of worrying headlines.
            The discourse around ethical AI often tends to take one of two sides: the humanities against techies, the responsible philosophers against the mad scientists. We bring together the two (plus some special guests) to offer a more balanced view of a variety of topics surrounding ethics in tech. From racist algorithms, to killer robots and beyond, we hope that by offering multiple perspectives we can help mitigate AI over-hype (no, Facebook’s chatbot didn’t really invent its own language), and highlight the more pressing issues (yes, AI really is racist).

            Amanda is a fourth-year PhD student who works with Professor Verena Rieser on detection and mitigation of abuse in social dialogue systems. Amanda led her university’s team in the 2018 Amazon Alexa Challenge during which they were finalists. She also co-hosts the podcast “Let’s Chat Ethics” which covers current issues in AI Ethics. She holds a bachelor’s in computer science from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Amanda believes AI development and design decisions should take a society-first approach, working towards a Hippocratic oath for AI with clearly defined ethical standards that researchers and developers should uphold.
