        <h3>The Ethical Algorithm</h3>
        <p>by Michael Kearns and Aaron Roth</p>
        <p>Over the course of a generation, algorithms have gone from mathematical abstractions to powerful mediators of daily life. Algorithms have made our lives more efficient, more entertaining, and, sometimes, better informed. At the same time, complex algorithms are increasingly violating the basic rights of individual citizens. Allegedly anonymized datasets routinely leak our most sensitive personal information; statistical models for everything from mortgages to college admissions reflect racial and gender bias. Meanwhile, users manipulate algorithms to "game" search engines, spam filters, online reviewing services, and navigation apps. Reporting from the cutting edge of scientific research, The Ethical Algorithm offers a new approach: a set of principled solutions based on the emerging and exciting science of socially aware algorithm design.</p>

        <h3>An Artificial Revolution: On Power, Politics and AI</h3>
        <p>by Ivana Bartoletti</p>
        <p>Privacy consultant and AI expert Ivana Bartoletti explores the urgent existential threat that artificial intelligence poses to international social justice When most people think about AI, they think about the future—from driverless cars and smart cities to HAL 9000 and the Terminator—and are unaware that AI is already creating a dystopian present. The third book in the Mood Indigo series argues that the rapid growth of the AI industry is threatening to undo decades of progress in human rights and global equality. AI has unparalleled transformative potential to reshape society, our economies and our working lives, but without legal scrutiny, international oversight and public debate, we are sleepwalking into a future written by algorithms which encode racist, sexist and classist biases into our daily lives. This book exposes the reality of the AI revolution, from the low-paid workers who toil to train algorithms to recognize cancerous polyps, to the rise of techno-racism and techno-chauvinism and the symbiotic relationship between AI and right wing populism.</p>

        <h3>Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy</h3>
        <p>by Cathy O'Neil</p>
        <p>We live in the age of the algorithm. Increasingly, the decisions that affect our lives--where we go to school, whether we can get a job or a loan, how much we pay for health insurance--are being made not by humans, but by machines. In theory, this should lead to greater fairness: Everyone is judged according to the same rules.
            But as mathematician and data scientist Cathy O'Neil reveals, the mathematical models being used today are unregulated and uncontestable, even when they're wrong. Most troubling, they reinforce discrimination--propping up the lucky, punishing the downtrodden, and undermining our democracy in the process.</p>

        <h3>Who Can You Trust?: How Technology is Rewriting the Rules of Human Relationships</h3>
        <p>by Rachel Botsman</p>
        <p>From government to business, banks to media, trust in institutions is at an all-time low. But this isn't the age of distrust--far from it.

            In this revolutionary book, world-renowned trust expert Rachel Botsman reveals that we are at the tipping point of one of the biggest social transformations in human history--with fundamental consequences for everyone. A new world order is emerging: we might have lost faith in institutions and leaders, but millions of people rent their home to total strangers, exchange digital currencies, or find themselves trusting a bot. This is the age of "distributed trust", a paradigm shift driven by innovative technologies that are rewriting the rules of an all-too-human relationship.

        <h3>Turned On: Science, Sex and Robots</h3>
        <p>by Kate Devlin</p>
        <p>The idea of the seductive sex robot is the stuff of myth, legend and science fiction. From the ancient Greeks to twenty-first century movies, robots in human form have captured our imagination, our hopes and our fears. But beyond the fantasies there are real and fundamental questions about our relationship with technology as it moves into the realm of robotics. Artificial intelligence raises very real concerns. Sexual activity is central to our very existence; it shapes how we think, how we act and how we live. With advances in technology come machines that may one day think independently. What will happen to us when we form close relationships with these intelligent systems?</p>

        <h3>Algorithms of Oppresion: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism</h3>
        <p>by Safiya Umoja Noble</p>
        <p>Run a Google search for "black girls" - what will you find? "Big Booty" and other sexually explicit terms are likely to come up as top search terms. But, if you type in "white girls," the results are radically different. The suggested porn sites and un-moderated discussions about "why black women are so sassy" or "why black women are so angry" presents a disturbing portrait of black womanhood in modern society.

            In Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Umoja Noble challenges the idea that search engines like Google offer an equal playing field for all forms of ideas, identities, and activities. Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color.</p>
